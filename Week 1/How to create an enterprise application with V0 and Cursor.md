1. Download the Cursor Desktop app
2. Git clone this repo: https://github.com/snarktank/ai-dev-tasks?tab=readme-ov-file 
3. Open this new git cloned folder in the Cursor Desktop App
4. Complete step #1 following the workflow of the Github repo. Here you will create a PRD, ensure it's saved within this codebase
	1. Prompt: Use @create-prd.md
	2. Here's the feature I want to build: [Describe your feature in detail]
	3. Reference these files to help you: [Optional: @file1.py @file2.ts]
5. Log into V0 (to save the work you will create later)
6. Give the PRD to V0
	1. Prompt: "Build the frontend to this project:", then paste in the PRD
7. After V0 generates the frontend, make sure it's to your liking
8. Download the source code and add it to the folder with the PRD; these should be in 1 folder
9. Open the folder you created (PRD, front-end code) in Cursor
10. In Ask mode within Cursor, follow step #2 in the snarktank repo README
	1. Prompt: Now take @MyFeature-PRD.md and create tasks using @generate-tasks.md
	2. Note: Replace `@MyFeature-PRD.md` with the actual filename of the PRD you generated in step #1
	3. You should have a task list generated and saved to the codebase
11. Read through step #3 in the snarktank repo README
12. Follow step #4 in the snarktank repo README
13. Follow step #5 in the snarktank repo README
	1. Note: As you progress the context used will increase. You'll get a notification at the bottom suggesting that you start a new chat to get better results
14. Ready to push to Github? Cursor can do that!
	1. Prompt: "I want to connect this local project to a remote repo (insert repo url here)"
	2. Cursor will handle the rest!
