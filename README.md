# ❤️🛠️ Build Log

Welcome to my Dev Log — a living journal of daily progress, ideas, experiments, and technical decisions. This repository serves as a chronicle of development work across projects, providing transparency, structure, and reflection over time.

### 💡 Purpose

The goal of this dev log is to:

- Track daily development activities and thought processes
- Document challenges, solutions, and key learnings
- Maintain a historical record of progress
- Encourage consistency and accountability

Whether it's a new feature, a bug fix, a refactor, or just exploring an idea — it all goes here.

### What are you doing now?

Currently I'm documenting my work within my AI Engineering Fellowship designing, implementing, and evaluating machine learning models for real-world use cases 🚀
