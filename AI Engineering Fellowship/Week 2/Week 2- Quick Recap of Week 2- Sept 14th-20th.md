## üõ†Ô∏è What I built and how I built it

- AI Art Critic Model in Kaggle following the¬†[Fast.AI](http://fast.ai/)¬†video and using my own (small dataset)
- Built an MCP Server using Cursor and MongoDB MCP Server; needs mongosh to complete more advanced toolings
- Created Winter Arc, which guides users through a story-driven journey to help them achieve their transformational goals.

## üìö Key Learnings

- Database privacy practices:
	- You need to add policies to your Supabase to make sure users can edit, view, and delete their own data
	- Run the original ‚Äòcreate table‚Äô and RLS policies to create the table, then after I don‚Äôt need it
- Thinking about the difference between AI and automation and the use cases for each. When would AI be essential for the efficiency of a task vs just a fancy add-on?
- Ensure a clean database design and setup before starting projects. It's important to know what a database will hold, the feature or action it supports, and does it interact with AI. This will all help with the SQL Schema Definition so I can more easily create the databases in the Supabase SQL Editor.
	- Think about permissions when creating the database design (admin vs user access)
	- Be careful switching between mock data and real data
- Creating a branch is foundational when working with AI Agents, even for personal projects; Cursor pushed a commit for me to main and didn‚Äôt ask me
- Research things I need to know for deployment before building project- didn‚Äôt know Vercel was strict in Typescript, put me more behind than I would‚Äôve liked in time

## üåü Accomplishments + Impact

- Really pleased with my AI Learning platform: Winter Arc- it aligns well with my mindset of self-improvement through cyberpunk story-telling. I definitely want to continue building it
	- Connected Google Gemini so the user can receive AI-generated tasks to help them with daily goal setting!
- Got to be introduced to so many new tools, at first struggling, but got the hang of it pretty quickly
- Created and tested my first AI model in Kaggle; analyzing the performance metrics was interesting to understand how the model 
- Created the Supabase schemas- got more familiar with Supabase database creation via SQL. I've always worked with MongoDB so this was cool to work with a relational database

## ‚õîÔ∏è Challenges & Blockers

- Finding a free AI Model to use ==> At first it was a blocker to find an AI that I could use that was free, but I found Google Gemini

## ‚òÄÔ∏è Next Steps / Looking Ahead

- Want to summarize my learnings into "learning blocks" i.e. how-to blogs, case studies, so that I can refer back to these at a later time. I feel like we learn so much every week and so I want to encapsulate it for later use. Also helps me better understand the concepts better
