- Problem: How to simulate the results of tutoring within a group learning setting?
- Alterable variables: These have different effects on learning
    - Quality of teaching
    - Use of time
    - Cognitive and affective entry characteristics of students
    - Formative testing
    - Rate of learning
    - Home environment
- Alterable variables with the strongest affects on school learning:
- It’s assumed that 2-3 variables must be used together in conventional learning to have the same affect as tutoring
    - Mastery learning could be one of these variables
    - Other variables are expected to have a .5 sigma effect or greater
    - More than 3 variables = too complex
    - Present research combination reach 2 SD, but does not go above it
- When are variables true to have an affect and when they’re not
    - Suggestive Additive results: ML + changes in teaching process
- This research only includes variables in the top half of table 1, other variables will be explored later
    - They have only done research with ML + one other variable; not 3
    - They try to combine 2 levels of schooling and 2 subjects
- How to improve learning without changing the teaching
    - Students develop good study habits, devote more time to learning, improve reading skills; ML needs this (cognitive and affective prerequisites)
    - ML creates a 1 SD with the same teacher, same instruction, and same material. Students are more optimistic about learning and apply themselves more
    - Possibility
        - Enhance the students’ cognitive and affective prerequisites early within an advanced ML course
