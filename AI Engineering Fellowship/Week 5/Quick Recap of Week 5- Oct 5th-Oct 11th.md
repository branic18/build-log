## 🛠️ What I Worked On
- Collaborated with senior and peer product manager to lead sprint planning for the upcoming development cycle. Defined the scope of a fully functional MVP by breaking down high-level requirements into actionable tasks, resulting in 16 detailed work tickets. Personally authored and organized all DevOps and Integration tickets, effectively coordinating work for a team of 8 engineers.


## 📚 What I Learned
- This experience deepened my understanding of sprint planning at scale, improved my ability to translate product goals into technical tasks, and taught me how to balance clarity and flexibility when defining work for cross-functional teams. I also gained firsthand insight into how thoughtful ticket writing can accelerate engineering velocity and reduce blockers mid-sprint.


## 🌟 What Went Well
- Sprint planning actually didn't take too long to do


## ⛔️ What Blocked Me
- N/A


## ☀️ Next Steps
- See how this sprint goes, take notes on how people so far about their tickets on Monday so we can adjust the tickets for next sprint
