## 🛠️ What I Worked On
- Collaborated with senior and peer product manager to lead sprint planning for the upcoming development cycle. Spent time defining what was done and what needed to be finished


## 📚 What I Learned
- This experience deepened my understanding of sprint planning at scale, improved my ability to translate product goals into technical tasks, and taught me how to balance clarity and flexibility when defining work for cross-functional teams.
- Learned more about how AI was pre-transformers


## 🌟 What Went Well
- We were able to start the sprint planning on Friday and going to continue on Monday


## ⛔️ What Blocked Me
- Taking a while to break down the AI paper from the Lunch and Learn but getting there


## ☀️ Next Steps
- Take notes on how people so far about their tickets on Monday so we can adjust the tickets for this upcoming sprint
