## 🛠️ What I Worked On
- Started working on my ticket to create the developer documentation. Even though I'm blocked by other tickets I worked on:
	- Data flows- Student Model + End-to-end
	- Mock lesson plan
	- User mock data
	- Rough Supabase seed data in the form of a TypeScript file
- Met with my integration team (Calvin and Danny) to talk about how our tickets are related to each other. Spoke with Sterling about the user schema, shared my rough data flow with him to help him with the user schema, so that I can accurately seed the necessary data

## 📚 What I Learned
- I'm learning how to seed data into Supabase, I have a rough code file, it's rough because 1) just trying to make sure I understand how the file works, i.e. what is it adding, when is the user being authenticated, etc. and 2) the backend team isn't finished, so wouldn't make sense to try to start seeding the data, but the backend isn't ready.


## 🌟 What Went Well
- Speaking with the necessary people related to my project, to make sure I'm aware of what's going on
- Learning more about Supabase


## ⛔️ What Blocked Me
- Frontend and backend teams are still working, so I can't complete the developer documentation or the seed data yet, although I have a rough for each. I'll finalize each when both teams are ready.

## ☀️ Next Steps
- Work more on code file for seed data
- Review the DevOps practices we’re doing in the Slack and add to the developer documentation
- Meet up w/ Calvin or Danny to see how their tickets are going
- Wait for frontend and backend teams to finish so I can finish my ticket


## 📝 Notes / Reflections
- This week was more foundational, but hope to dig deeper next week
