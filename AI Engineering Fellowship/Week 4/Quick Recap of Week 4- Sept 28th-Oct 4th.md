## 🛠️ What I Worked On
- Trying to get the seed data integrated into the frontend. Working with Layomi to see how we could do that. Layomi was able to link Clerk to the frontend student dashboard, but there's no central student account for everyone to use, so the seed data would be more useful for the admin dashboard, which is something we're not focusing on right now.


## 📚 What I Learned
- Having clearer tickets with acceptance criteria and definition of done helps a lot. I didn't realize at first that the seed data would be most useful for the admin dashboard if new student users are going to be created. I thought it would be one student account that would be used. Overall understanding the scenario and context around my ticket would've helped a lot in the beginning, so making sure that's covered before I start the ticket.
	- Doing a ticket relational map in the beginning


## 🌟 What Went Well
- Figured out the seed data use case, it's loaded to Supabase, just not actively being accessed because it can't be accessed because we have different user accounts.


## ⛔️ What Blocked Me
- Understanding when and where the seed data should be accessed


## ☀️ Next Steps
- Excited to move into next week and get deeper into the project
