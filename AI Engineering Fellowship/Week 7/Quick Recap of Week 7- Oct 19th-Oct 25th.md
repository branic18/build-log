## 🛠️ What I Worked On
- Created a system design of how the Vercel SDK could work with Replicate and Supabase
- Started working on AI ticket with team to fine tune our model for the learning tool using Replicate through the Vercel AI SDK. I took notes creating cohesive understanding of our ticket and where our gaps of understanding were. We decided to split and do research on the following:
	- Do some research on how to setup guardrails; don’t give answers, give a quality answer, ask follow-up questions/ questions for clarity
    - What makes a tutor a good tutor and how to replicate it in the form of a chatbot?
    - What are the capabilities of Llama 3? How does it help our use case?
- I summarized my research in a Google Doc and hope to publish it as an article; helping highlighting the kind of AI work I did during the fellowship


## 📚 What I Learned
- Replicate doesn't support fine-tuning for language models, only image models
- The requirements of fine-tuning
- The techniques and methods of fine-tuning; pros and cons of each in relation to our use case
- Kinds of libraries that can be used
- How to possibly track how well the model is fine-tuned


## 🌟 What Went Well
- Got to meet up with my AI Team and get started on the ticket
- Related my research back to the product goals


## ⛔️ What Blocked Me
- What blocked us as a team was that we were all trying to juggle going to conferences and doing interview prep for interviews, so we didn't get started until later in the week 
- We did not have the details related to tracking student progress, so this part will not be implemented into the fine-tuning until that's fully fleshed out


## ☀️ Next Steps
- Prepare to implement the research and fine-tune the Llama 3 model
- Jump start on the dataset stuff
